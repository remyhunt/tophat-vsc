## Credits and Thanks

This extension was inspired by [this](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/src/index.html) popular github repository for HTML5 boilerplate, and this [blog post](https://www.matuzo.at/blog/html-boilerplate/) by Manuel Manuel Matuzovic. The markup used are all common and good  practices for SEO and accesibility. The writer of this post elegantly published the markup with details and justification line-by-line. I highly recommend visiting that post.
